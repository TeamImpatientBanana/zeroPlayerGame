A Zero Player Game
==============
This is a zero player game made by the YSU team at Kent Hack Enough 2014. Because the YSU team had more than 4 people in it we didn't qualify for any prizes, but I think a lot of people learned a bunch and had a great time anyway.

Thanks so much for the KHE team for having us!

##To play

Simply clone the master branch and launch index.html in a HTML5 browser. The game is all HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and is completely client side. It should pretty much run on anything.
