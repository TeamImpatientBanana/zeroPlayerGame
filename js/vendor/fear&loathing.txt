Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas
A Savage Journey To The Heart Of The American Dream
 
By Hunter S. Thompson

PART ONE
 
We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a
bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive. . . ." And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was
going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And
a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"
Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was
pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process. "What the
hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his
eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind,"
I said. "It's your turn to drive." I hit the brakes and aimed the Great
Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those
bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.
It was almost noon, and we still had more than a hundred miles to go. They
would be tough miles. Very soon, I knew, we would both be completely
twisted. But there was no going back, and no time to rest. We would
have to ride it out. Press registration for the fabulous Mint 400 was
already underway, and we had to get there by four to claim our sound -
proof suite. A fashionable sporting magazine in New York had taken care
of the reservations, along with this huge red Chevy convertible we'd
just rented off a lot on the Sunset Strip . . . and I was, after all,
a professional journalist; so I had an obligation to cover the story,
for good or ill.
The sporting editors had also given me $300 in cash, most of which was
already spent on extremely dangerous drugs. The trunk of the car looked
like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had two bags of grass, seventy -
five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high - powered blotter acid,
a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi - colored
uppers, downers, screamers, laughers and also a quart of tequila, a quart
of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.All
this had been rounded up the night before, in a frenzy of high - speed
driving all over Los Angeles County - from Topanga to Watts, we picked
up everything we could get our hands on. Not that we needed all that
for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection,
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing
in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man
in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten
stuff pretty soon. Probably at the next gas station. We had sampled
almost everything else, and now - yes, it was time for a long snort
of ether. And then do the next hundred miles in a horrible, slobbering
sort of spastic stupor. The only way to keep alert on ether is to do up
a lot of amyls - not all at once, but steadily, just enough to maintain
the focus at ninety miles an hour through Barstow.
"Man, this is the way to travel," said my attorney. He leaned over to
turn the volume up on the radio, humming along withthe rhythm section
and kind of moaning the words: "One toke over the line, Sweet Jesus
. . . One toke over the line . . . " 
One toke? You poor fool! Wait till you see those goddamn bats. I could
barely hear the radio . . . slumped over on the far side of the seat,
grappling with a tape recorder turned all the way up on "Sympathy for the
Devil." That was the only tape we had, so we played it constantly, over
and over, as a'kind of demented counterpoint to the radio. And also to
maintain our rhythm on the road. A constant speed is good for gas mileage
- and for some reason that seemed important at the time. Indeed. On a
trip like this one must be careful about gas consumption. Avoid those
quick bursts of acceleration that drag blood to the back of the brain.
My attorney saw the hitchhiker long before I did. "Let's give this boy
a lift," he said, and before I could mount any argument he was stopped
and this poor Okie kid was running up to the car with a big grin on his
face, saying, "Hot damn! I never rode in a convertible before!"
"Is that right?" I said. "Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?"
The kid nodded eagerly as we roared off.
"We're your friends," said my attorney. "We're not like the others."
"0 Christ, I thought, he's gone around the bend. "No more of that talk,"
I said sharply. "Or I'll put the leeches on you." He grinned, seeming
to understand. Luckily, the noise in the car was so awful - between the
wind and the radio and the tape machine - that the kid in the back seat
couldn't hear a word we were saying. Or could he?
How long can we maintain? I wondered. How long before one of us starts
raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same
lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family. Will he make
that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and
huge manta rays coming down on the car? If so - well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying
that we can't turn him loose. He'll report us at once to some kind of
outback nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs.
Jesus! Did I say that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear
me? I glanced over at my attorney, but he seemed oblivious - watching
the road, driving our Great Red Shark along at a hundred and ten or
so. There was no sound from the back seat.Maybe I'd better have a chat
with this boy, I thought. Perhape if I explain things, he'll rest easy.
Of course. I leaned around in the seat and gave him a fine big smile
. . . admiring the shape of his skull."By the way," I said. "There's
one thing you should probably understand."
He stared at me, not blinking. Was he gritting his teeth?
"Can you hear me?" I yelled.
He nodded.
"That's good," I said. "Because I want you to know that we're on our
way to Las Vegas to find the American Dream." I smiled. "That's why we
rented this car. It was the only way to do it. Can you grasp that?"
He nodded again, but his eyes were nervous.
"I want you to have all the background," I said. "Because this
is a very ominous assignment - with overtones of extreme personal
danger. . . . Hell, I forgot all about this beer; you want one?"
He shook his head.
"How about some ether?" I said.
"What?"
"Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. You see, about
twenty - four hours ago we were sitting in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly
Hills Hotel - in the patio section, of course - and we were just sitting
there under a palm tree when this uniformed dwarf came up to me with a
pink telephone and said, 'This must be the call you've been waiting for
all this time, sir.'"
I laughed and ripped open a beer can that foamed all over the back seat
while I kept talking. "And you know? He was right! I'd been expecting
that call, but I didn't know who it would come from. Do you follow me?"
The boy's face was a mask of pure fear and bewilderment. I blundered on:
"I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's
not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. Shit, look at him! He doesn't
look like you or me, right? That's because he's a foreigner. I think he's
probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?"
"Oh, hell no!" he blurted.
"I didn't think so," I said. "Because in spite of his race, this man is
extremely valuable to me." I glanced over at my attorney, but his mind
was somewhere else.
I whacked the back of the driver's seat with my fist. "This is important,
goddamnit! This is a true story!" The car swerved sickeningly, then
straightened out. "Keep your hands off my fucking neck!" my attorney
screamed. The kid in the back looked like he wasready to jump right
out of the car and take his chances.Our vibrations were getting nasty -
but why? I was puzzled, frustrated. Was there no communication in this
car? Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
Because my story was true. I was certain of that. And it was extremely
important, I felt, for the meaning of our journey to be made absolutely
clear. We had actually been sitting there in the Polo Lounge - for
many hours - drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side and beer
chasers. And when the call came, I was ready.
The Dwark approached our table cautiously, as I recall, and when he
handed me the pink telephone I said nothing, merely listened. And then
I hung up, turning to face my attorney. 
"That was headquarters," I said. "They want me to go to Las 
Vegas at once, and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named
Lacerda. He'll have the details. All I have to do is check into my suite
and he'll seek me out."
My attorney said nothing for a moment, then he suddenly came alive in
his chair. "God hell!" he exclaimed. "I think I see the pattern. This
one sounds like real trouble!" He tucked his khaki undershirt into his
white rayon bellbottoms and called for more drink. "You're going to need
plenty of legal advice before this thing is over," he said. "And my first
advice is that you should rent a very fast car with no top and get the
hell out of L.A. for at least forty - eight hours." He shook his head
sadly. "This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with
you - and we'll have to ann ourselves."
"Why not?" I said. "If a thing like this is worth doing at all, it's
worth doing right. We'll need some decent equipment and plenty of cash
on the line - if only for drugs and a super - sensitive tape recorder,
for the sake of a permanent record."
"What kind of a story is this?" he asked.
"The Mint 400," I said. "It's the richest off - the - road race for
motorcycles and dune - buggies in the history of organized sport - a
fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero named Del Webb,
who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Las Vegas
. . . at least that's what the press release says; my man in New York
just read it to me."
"Well," he said, "as your attorney I advise you to buy a motorcycle. How
else can you cover a thing like this righteously?"
"No way," I said. "Where can we get hold of a Vincent Black Shadow?"
"What's that?"
"A fantastic bike," I said. "The new model is something like two thousand
cubic inches, developing two hundred brake - horsepower at four thousand
revolutions per minute on a magnesium frame with two styrofoam seats
and a total curb weight of exactly two hundred pounds."
"That sounds about right for this gig," he said.
"It is" I assured him. "The fucker's not much for turning, but it's pure
hell on the straightaway. It'll outrun the F - ill until takeoff."
"Takeoff?" he said. "Can we handle that much torque?"
"Absolutely," I said. "I'll call New York for some cash."
 
2. The Seizure of $300 from a Pig Woman In Beverly Hills
 
The New York office was not familiar with the Vincent Black Shadow:
they referred me to the Los Angeles bureau - which is actually in Beverly
Hills just a few long blocks from the Polo Lounge - but when I got there,
the money - woman refused to give me more than $300 in cash. She had
no idea who I was, she said, and by that time I was pouring sweat. My
blood is too thick for California: I have never been able to properly
explain myself in this climate. Not with the soaking sweats . . . wild
red eyeballs and trembling hands.
So I took the $300 and left. My attorney was waiting in a bar around the
corner. "This won't make the nut," he said, "unless we have unlimited
credit."
I assured him we would. "You Samoans are all the same," I told him. "You
have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture. Jesus,
just one hour ago we were sitting over there in that stinking baiginio,
stone broke and paralyzed for the weekend, when a call comes through
from some total stranger in New York, telling me to go to Las Vegas and
expenses be damned - and then he sends me over to some office in Beverly
Hills where another total stranger gives me $300 raw cash for no reason at
all . . . I tell you, my man, this is the American Dream in action! We'd
be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way out to the end."
"Indeed," he said. "We must do it."
"Right," I said. "But first we need the car. And after that, the
cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco
shirts." The only way to prepare for a trip like this, I felt, was to
dress up like human peacocks and get crazy, then screech off across the
desert and cover the stary. 
Never lose sight of the primary responsibility. But what was the
story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on
our own. Free Enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on
drugs in Las Vegas. Do it now: pure Gonzo journalism.
There was also the socio - psychic factor. Every now and then when your
life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in, the only real
cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard
from Hollywood to Las Vegas. To relax, as it were, in the womb of the
desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face
with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume,
and at least a pint of ether.
Getting hold of the drugs had been no problem, but the car and the tape
recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon
in Hollywood. I already had one car, but it was far too small and slow
for desert work. We went to a Polynesian bar, where my attorney made
seventeen calls before locating a convertible with adequate horsepower
and proper coloring.
"Hang onto it," I heard him say into the phone. "We'll be over to make
the trade in thirty minutes." Then after a pause, he began shouting:
"What? Of course the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize
who the fuck you're talking to?"
"Don't take any guff from these swine," I said as he slammed the phone
down. "Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing
dinky. We want one of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice -
activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars."
We made several more calls and finally located our equip - ment in
a store about five miles away. It was closed, but the salesman said
he would wait, if we hurried. But we were de - layed en route when a
Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. The
store was closed by the time we got there. There were people inside,
but they refused to come to the double - glass door until we gave it a
few belts and made ourselves clear.
Finally two salesmen brandishing tire irons came to the door and we
managed to negotiate the sale through a tiny slit. Then they opened the
door just wide enough to shove the equipment out, before slamming and
locking it again. "Now take that stuff and get the hell away from here,"
one of them shouted through the slit.
My attorney shook his fist at them. "We'll be back," he yelled. "One of
these days I'll toss a fucking bomb into this place! I have your name on
this sales slip! I'll find out where you live and burn your house down!"
"That'll give him something to think about," he muttered as we drove
off. "That guy is a paranoid psychotic, anyway. They're easy to spot."
We had trouble, again, at the car rental agency. After signing all the
papers, I got in the car and almost lost control of it while backing
across the lot to the gas pump. The rental - man was obviously shaken.
"Say there . . . uh . . . you fellas are going to be careful with this
car, aren't you?"
"Of course."
"Well, good god!" he said. "You just backed over that two - foot concrete
abutment and you didn't even slow down! Forty - five in reverse! And
you barely missed the pump!"
"No harm done," I said. "I always test a transmission that way. The rear
end. For stress factors."
Meanwhile, my attorney was busy transferring rum and ice from the Pinto ~
the back seat of the convertible. The rental - man watched him nervously.
"Say," he said. "Are you fellas drinking?"
"Not me," I said.
"Just fill the goddamn tank," my attorney snapped. "We're in a hell of
a hurry. We're on our way to Las Vegas for a desert race.
"What?"
"Never mind," I said. "We're responsible people." I watched him put the
gas cap on, then I jammed the thing into low gear and we lurched into
traffic.
"There's another worrier," said my attorney. "He's prob - ably all
cranked up on speed."
"Yeah, you should have given him some reds."
"Reds wouldn't help a pig like that," he said. "To hell with him. We
have a lot of business to take care of, before we can get on the road."
"I'd like to get hold of some priests' robes," I said. "They might come
in handy in Las Vegas."
But there were no costume stores open, and we weren't up to burglarizing
a church. "Why bother?" said my attorney. 
"And you have to remember that a lot of cops are good vicious
Catholics. Can you imagine what those bastards would do to us if we got
busted all drugged - up and drunk in stolen investments? Jesus, they'd
castrate us!"
"You're right," I said. "And for christ's sake don't smoke that pipe at
stoplights. Keep in mind that we're exposed."
He nodded. "We need a big hookah. Keep it down here on the seat, out of
sight. If anybody sees us, they'll think we're using oxygen."
We spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the
car. Then we ate the mescaline and went swimming in the ocean. Somewhere
around dawn we had breakfast in a Malibu coffee shop, then drove very
carefully across town and plunged onto the smog - shrouded Pasadena
Freeway, heading East.
 
3. Strange Medicine On The Desert . . . A Crisis Of Confidence
 
I am still vaguely haunted by our hitchhiker's remark about how he'd
"never rode in a convertible before." Here's this poor geek living in
a world of convertibles zipping past him on the highways all the time,
and he's never even ridden in one. It made me feel like King Farouk. I
was tempted to have my attorney pull into the next airport and arrange
some kind of simple, common - law contract whereby we could just give
the car to this unfortunate bastard. Just say: "Here, sign this and
the car's yours." Give him the keys and then use the credit card to zap
off on a jet to some place like Miami and rent another huge fireapple -
red convertible for a drug - addled, top - speed run across the water
all the way out to the last stop in Key West . . . and then trade the
car off for a boat. Keep moving.
But this manic notion passed quickly. There was no point in getting this
harmless kid locked up - and, besides, I had plans for this car. I was
looking forward to flashing around Las Vegas in the bugger. Maybe do a
bit of serious drag - racing on the Strip: Pull up to that big stoplight
in front of the Flamingo and start screaming at the traffic:
"Alright, you chickenshit wimps! You pansies! When this goddamn light
flips green, I'm gonna stomp down on this thing and blow every one of
you gutless punks off the road!"
Right. Challenge the bastards on their own turf. Come Screeching up to
the crosswalk, bucking and skidding with a bottle of rum in one hand and
jamming the horn to drown out the music . . . glazed eyes insanely dilated
behind tiny black, gold - rimmed greaser shades, screaming gibberish..,
a genuinely dangerous drunk, reeking of ether and terminal psychosis. 
Revving the engine up to a terrible high - pitched chattering whine,
waiting for the light to change . . . 
How often does a chance like that come around? To jangle the bastards
right down to the core of their spleens. Old elephants limp off to the
hills to die; old Americans go out to the highway and drive themselves
to death with huge cars.
But our trip was different. It was a classic affirmation of everything
right and true and decent in the national character. It was a gross,
physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country -
but only for those with true grit. And we were chock full of that.
My attorney understood this concept, despite his racial handicap, but
our hitchhiker was not an easy person to reach. He said he understood,
but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
The car suddenly veered off the road and we came to a sliding halt in
the gravel. I was hurled against the dashboard. My attorney was slumped
over the wheel. "What's wrong?" I yelled. "We can't stop here. This is
bat country!"
"My heart," he groaned. "Where's the medicine?"
"Oh," I said. "The medicine, yes, it's right here." I reached into
the kit - bag for the amyls. The kid seemed petrified. "Don't worry,"
I said. "This man has a bad heart - Angina Pectoris. 
But we have the cure for it. Yes, here they are." I picked four amyls
out of the tin box and handed two of them to my attorney. He immediately
cracked one under his nose, and I did likewise.
He took a long snort and fell back on the seat, staring straight up at
the sun. "Turn up the fucking music!" he screamed. "My heart feels like
an alligator!
"Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass!" He flailed his naked arms
at the sky. "What's wrong with us? Are we god - damn old ladies?"
I turned both the radio and the tape machine up full bore. "You scurvy
shyster bastard," I said. "Watch your language! You're talking to a
doctor of journalism!"
He was laughing out of control. "What the fuck are we doing out here on
this desert?" he shouted. "Somebody call the police! We need help!"
"Pay no attention to this swine," I said to the hitchhiker. "He can't
handle the medicine. Actually, we're both doctors of journalism, and we're
on our way to Las Vegas to cover the main story of our generation." And
then I began laughing . . . .
My attorney hunched around to face the hitchhiker. "The truth is," he
said, "we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've
known him for years, but he ripped us off - and you know what that means,
right?"
I wanted to shut him off, but we were both helpless with laughter. What
the fuck were we doing out here on this desert, when we both had bad
hearts?
"Savage Henry has cashed his check!" My attorney snarled at the kid in
the back seat. "We're going to rip his lungs out!"
"And eat them!" I blurted. "That bastard won't get away with this! What's
going on in this country when a scumsucker like that can get away with
sandbagging a doctor of journalism?"
Nobody answered. My attorney was cracking another amyl and the kid was
climbing out of the back seat, scrambling down the trunk lid. "Thanks
for the ride," he yelled. "Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry
about me." His feet hit the asphalt and he started running back towards
Baker. Out in the middle of the desert, not a tree in sight.
Wait a minute," I yelled. "Come back and get a beer." But apparently he
couldn't hear me. The music was very loud, and he was moving away from
us at good speed.
"Good riddance," said my attorney. "We had a real freak on our
hands. That boy made me nervous. Did you see his eyes?" He was still
laughing. "Jesus," he said. "This is good medicine!"
I opened the door and reeled around to the driver's side. "Move over,"
I said. "I'll drive. We have to get out of Califor - nia before that
kid finds a cop."
"Shit, that'll be hours," said my attorney. "He's a hundred miles from
anywhere."
"So are we," I said.
"Let's turn around and drive back to the Polo Lounge," he said. "They'll
never look for us there."
I ignored him. "Open the tequila," I yelled as the wind - scream took
over again; I stomped on the accelerator as we hurtled back onto the
highway. Moments later he leaned over with a map. "There's a place up
ahead called Mescal Springs," he said. "As your attorney, I advise you
to stop and take a swim.
I shook my head. "It's absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint
Hotel before the deadline for press registration," I said. "Otherwise,
we might have to pay for our suite."
He nodded. "But let's forget that bullshit about the American Dream," he
said. "The important thing is the Great Samoan Dream." He was rummaging
around in the kit - bag. 
"I think it's about time to chew up a blotter," he said. "That cheap
mescaline wore off a long time ago, and I don't know if 1 can stand the
smell of that goddamn ether any longer."
"I like it," I said. "We should soak a towel with the stuff and then put
it down on the floorboard by the accelerator so the fumes will rise up
in my face all the way to Las Vegas."
He was turning the tape cassette over. The radio was screaming:
"Power to the People - Right On!" John Lennon's political song, ten
years too late. "That poor fool should have stayed where he was," said
my attorney. "Punks like that just get in the way when they try to be
serious."
"Speaking of serious," I said. "I think it's about time to get into the
ether and the cocaine."
"Forget ether," he said. "Let's save it for soaking down the rug in the
suite. But here's this. Your half of the sunshine blotter. Just chew it
up like baseball gum."
I took the blotter and ate it. My attorney was now fumbling with the salt
shaker containing the cocaine. Opening it. Spilling it. Then screaming
and grabbing at the air, as our fine white dust blew up and out across
the desert highway. A very expensive little twister rising up from the
Great Red Shark. 
"Oh, Jesus!" he moaned. "Did you see what God just did to us?"
"God didn't do that!" I shouted. "You did it. You're a fucking narcotics
agent! I was on to your stinking act from the start, you pig!"
"You better be careful," he said. And suddenly he was waving a fat black
.357 magnum at me. One of those snubnosed Colt Python 5 with the beveled
cylinder. "Plenty of vultures out here," he said. "They'll pick your
bones clean before morning."
"You whore" I said. "When we get to Las Vegas I'll have you chopped into
hamburger. What do you think the Drug Bund will do when I show up with
a Samoan narcotics agent?"
"They'll kill us both," he said. "Savage Henry knows who I am. Shit,
I'm your attornney" He burst into wild laughter.
"You're full of acid, you fool. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can
get to the hotel and check in before you turn into a wild animal. Are
you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with
intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid?" He was laughing
again, then he jammed his nose down toward the salt shaker, aiming the
thin green roll of a $20 bill straight into what was left of the powder.
"How long do we have?" I said.
"Maybe thirty more minutes," he replied. "As your attorney I advise you
to drive at top speed."
Las Vegas was just up ahead. I could see the strip/hotel skyline looming
up through the blue desert ground - haze: The Sahara, the landmark, the
Americana and the ominous Thunderbird - a cluster of grey rectangles in
the distance, rising out of the cactus.
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close. The objective was the big
tower of the Mint Hotel, downtown - and if we didn't get there before we
lost all control, there was also the Nevada State prison upstate in Carson
City. I had been there once, but only for a talk with the prisoners -
and I didn't want to go back, for any reason at all. So there was really
no choice: 
We would have to run the gauntlet, and acid be damned. Go through all
the official gibberish, get the car into the hotel garage, work out on
the desk clerk, deal with the bellboy, sign in for the press passes -
all of it bogus, totally illegal, a fraud on its face, but of course it
would have to be done.
 
"KILL THE BODY AND THE HEAD WILL DIE"
 
This line appears in my notebook, for some reason. Perhaps some connection
with Joe Frazier. Is he still alive? Still able to talk? I watched that
fight in Seattle - horribly twisted about four seats down the aisle from
the Governor. A very painful experience in every way, a proper end to the
sixties Tim Leary a prisoner of Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria, Bob Dylan
clipping coupons in Greenwich Village, both Kennedysmurdered by mutants,
Owsley folding napkins on Terminal Island, and finally Cassius/Ali belted
incredibly off his pedestal by a human hamburger, a man on the verge of
death. Joe Frazier, like Nixon, had finally prevailedfor reasons that
people like me refused to understand - at least not out loud.
But that was some other era, burned out and long gone from the brutish
realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971. A lot of things had changed
in those years. And now I was in Las Vegas as the motor sports editor of
this fine slick magazine that had sent me out here in the Great Red Shark
for some reason that nobody claimed to understand. "Just check it out,"
they said, "and we'll take it from there.
Indeed. Check it out. But when we finally arrived at the Mint Hotel my
attorney was unable to cope artfully with the registration procedure. We
were forced to stand in line with all the others - which proved to be
extremely difficult under the circumstances. I kept telling myself:
"Be quiet, be calm, say nothing . . . speak only when spoken to: name,
rank and press affiliation, nothing else, ignore this terrible drug,
pretend it's not happening. . .There is no way to explain the terror I
felt when I finally lunged up to the clerk and began babbling. All my
well - re - hearsed lines fell apart under that woman's stoney glare. "Hi
there," I said. "My name is . . . ah, Raoul Duke . . . yes, on the list,
that's for sure. Free lunch, final wisdom, total coverage. . . . why
not? I have my attorney with me and I realize of course that his name is
not on the list, but we must have that suite, yes, this man is actually
my driver. We brought this Red Shark all the way from the Strip and now
it's time for the desert, right? Yes. Just check the list and you'll
see. Don't worry. What's the score here? What's next?"
The woman never blinked. "Your room's not ready yet," she said. "But
there's somebody looking for you."
"No!" I shouted. "Why? We haven't done anything yet!" My legs felt
rubbery. I gripped the desk and sagged toward her as she held out the
envelope, but I refused to accept it. The Woman's face was changing:
swelling, pulsing . . . horrible green jowls and fangs jutting out, the
face of a Moray Eel! Deadly poison! I lunged backwards into my attorney,
who gripped my arm as he reached out to take the note. "I'll handle this,"
he said to the Moray woman. 
"This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine. My name is
Doctor Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once. We'll be in the bar."
The woman shrugged as he led me away. In a town full of bedrock crazies,
nobody even notices an acid freak. 
We struggled through the crowded lobby and found two stools at the bar. My
attorney ordered two cuba libres with beer and mescal on the side, then
he opened the envelope. "Who's Lacerda?" he asked. "He's waiting for us
in a room on the twelfth floor."
I couldn't remember. Lacerda? The name rang a bell, but I couldn't
concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us. Right next to
me a huge reptile was gnawing on a woman's neck, the carpet was a blood -
soaked sponge - impossible to walk on it, no footing at all. "Order some
golf shoes," I whispered. "Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place
alive. You notice these lizards don't have any trouble moving around in
this muck - that's because they have claws on their feet."
"Lizards?" he said. "If you think we're in trouble now, wait till you see
what's happening in the elevators." He took off his Brazilian sunglasses
and I could see he'd been crying. "I just went upstairs to see this man
Lacerda," he said. "I told him we knew what he was up to. He says he's
a photographer, but when I mentioned Savage Henry - well, that did it;
he freaked. I could see it in his eyes. He knows we're onto him."
"Does he understand we have magnums?" I said.
"No. But I told him we had a Vincent Black Shadow. That scared the piss
out of him."
"Good," I said. "But what about our room? And the golf shoes? We're
right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo! And somebody's giving
booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to
shreds. Jesus, look at the floor! Have you ever seen so much blood? How
many have theykilled already?" I pointed across the room to a group
that seemed to be staring at us. "Holy shit, look at that bunch over
there! They've spotted us!"
"That's the press table," he said. "That's where you have to sign in
for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that,
and I'll get the room."
 
4. Rude Music And The Sound Of Many Shotguns . . . Rude Vibes On A
Saturday Evening In Vegas
 
We finally got into the suite around dusk, and my attorney was immediately
on the phone to room service - ordering four club sandwiches, four
shrimp cocktails, a quart of rum and nine fresh grapefruits. "Vitamin C,"
he explained. "We'll need all we can get."
I agreed. By this time the drink was beginning to cut the acid and my
hallucinations were down to a tolerable level. The room service waiter had
a vaguely reptilian cast to his features, but I was no longer seeing huge
pterodactyls lumbering around the corridors in pools of fresh blood. 
The only problem now was a gigantic neon sign outside the window,
blocking our view of the mountains - millions of colored balls running
around a very complicated track, strange symbols & filigree, giving off
a loud hum.
"Look outside," I said.
"Why?"
"There's a big .. . machine in the sky, . . . some kind of electric
snake . . . coming straight at us."
"Shoot it," said my attorney.
"Not yet," I said. "I want to study its habits." He 
went over to the corner and began pulling on a chain todrapes. "Look,"
he said, "you've got to stop this talk snakes and leeches and lizards
and that stuff. It's making me sick."
"Don't worry," I said.
"Worry? Jesus, I almost went crazy down there in the bar. They'll never
let us back in that place - not after your 
scene at the press table."
"What scene?"
"You bastard," he said. "I left you alone for three minutes! You scared
the shit out of those people! Waving that goddamn marlin spike around
and yelling about reptiles. You're lucky I came back in time. They were
ready to call the cops. I said you were only drunk and that I was taking
you up to your room for a cold shower. Hell,the only reason they gave
us the press passes was to get you out of there."
He was pacing around nervously. "Jesus, that scene straightened me right
out! I must have some drugs. What have you done with the mescaline?"
"The kit - bag," I said.
He opened the bag and ate two pellets while I got the tape machine
going. "Maybe you should only eat one of these," he said. "That acid's
still working on you."
I agreed. "We have to go out to the track before dark," I said. "But we
have time to watch the TV news. Let's carve up this grapefruit and make
a fine rum punch, maybe toss in a blotter . . . where's the car?"
"We gave it to somebody in the parking lot," he said. "I have the ticket
in my briefcase."
"What's the number? I'll call down and have them wash the bastard,
get rid of that dust and grime."
"Good idea," he said. But he couldn't find the ticket.
"Well, we're fucked," I said. "We'll never convince them to give us that
car without proof."
He thought for a moment, then picked up the phone and asked for the
garage. "This is Doctor Gonzo in eight fifty," he said. "I seem to have
lost my parking stub for that red convertible I left with you, but I
want the car washed and ready to go in thirty minutes. Can you send
up a duplicate stub? . . . What . . . Oh? . . . Well, that's fine." He
hung up and reached for the hash pipe. "No problem," hesaid. "That man
remembers my face."
"That's good," I said. "They'll probably have a big net for us when we
show up."shook his head. "As your attorney, I advise you not to about
me."
The TV news was about the Laos Invasion - a series of horrifying
disasters: explosions and twisted wreckage, men fleeing in terror,
Pentagon generals babbling insane lies. 
"Turn that shit off!" screamed my attorney "Let's get out of here!"
A wise move. Moments after we picked up the car my attorney went into
a drug coma and ran a red light on Main Street before I could bring us
under control. I propped him up in the passenger seat and took the wheel
myself . . . feeling fine, extremely sharp. All around me in traffic I
could see people talking and I wanted to hear what they were saying. All
of them. But the shotgun mike was in the trunk and I decided to leave
it there. Las Vegas is not the kind of town where you want to drive down
Main Street aiming a black bazooka - looking instrument at people.Turn up
the radio. Turn up the tape machine. Look into the sunset up ahead. Roll
the windows down for a better taste of the cool desert wind. Ah yes. This
is what it's all about. Total control now. Tooling along the main drag
on a Saturday night in Las Vegas, two good old boys in a fireapple -
red convertible . . . stoned, ripped, twisted . . . Good People.
Great God! What is this terrible music?
"The Battle Hymn of Lieutenant Galley":
 
" . . . as we go marching on
When I reach my final campground, in that land 
beyond the sun,
and the Great Commander asks me . . . "
(What did he ask you, Rusty?)
"Did you fight or did you run?"
(and what did you tell him, Rusty?)
" . . . We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had . . . "
 
No! I can't be hearing this! It must be the drug. I glanced over at my
attorney, but he was staring up at the sky, and I could see that his
brain had gone off to that campground 
beyond the sun. Thank christ he can't hear this music, I thought. It
would drive him into a racist frenzy.
Mercifully, the song ended. But my mood was already shattered . . . and
now the fiendish cactus juice took over, plunging me into a sub - human
funk as we suddenly came up on the turnoff to the Mint Gun Club. "One
mile," the sign said. But even a mile away I could hear the crackling
scream of two - stroke bike engines winding out . . . and then, coming
closer, I heard another sound.
Shotguns! No mistaking that fiat hollow boom.
I stopped the car. What the hell is going on down there? 
I rolled up all the windows and eased down the gravel road, hunched low
on the wheel . . . until I saw about a dozen figures pointing shotguns
into the air, firing at regular intervals.
Standing on a slab of concrete out here in the mesquite - desert,
this scraggly little oasis in a wasteland north of Vegas . . They were
clustered, with their shotguns, about fifty yards away from a one -
story concrete/block - house, half - shaded by ten or twelve trees and
surrounded by cop - cars, bike - trailers and motorcycles.
Of course. The Mint Gun Club! These lunatics weren't letting anything
interfere with their target practice. Here were about a hundred bikers,
mechanics and assorted motorsport types milling around in the pit area,
signing in for tomorrow's race, idly sipping beers and appraising each
other's machinery - and right in the middle of all this, oblivious to
everything but the clay pigeons flipping out of the traps every five
seconds or so, the shotgun people never missed a beat.
Well, why not? I thought. The shooting provided a certain rhythm -
sort of a steady bass - line - to the high - pitched chaos of the bike
scene. I parked the car and wandered into the crowd, leaving my attorney
in his coma.
I bought a beer and watched the bikes checking in. Many
Husquavarnas, high - tuned Swedish fireballs . . . also Yamahas,
Kawasakis, a few 500 Triumphs, Maicos, & there a CZ, a Pursang . . . all
very fast, super - light dfrt bikes. No Hogs in this league, not even a
Sportster . . . that would be like entering our Great Red Shark in the
dune buggy competition.
Maybe I should do that, I thought. Sign my attorney up as the driver,
then send him out to the starting line with a head full of ether and
acid. How would they handle it?Nobody would dare go out on the track
with a person that crazy. He would roll on the first turn, and take out
four or five dune buggies - a Kamikaze trip.
"What's the entry fee?" I asked the desk - man.
"Two fifty," he said.
"What if I told you I had a Vincent Black Shadow?"He stared up at me,
saying nothing, not friendly. I noticed he was wearing a .38 revolver
on his belt. "Forget it," I said. "My driver's sick, anyway."
His eyes narrowed. "Your driver ain't the only one sick around here,
buddy."
"He has a bone in his throat," I said.
"What?"
The man was getting ugly, but suddenly his eyes switched away. He was
staring at something else
My attorney no longer wearing his Danish sunglasses, no longer wearing
his Acapulco shirt . . . a very crazy looking ,half - naked and breathing
heavily.
"What's the trouble here?" he croaked. "This man is my client - Are
you prepared to go to court?" grabbed his shoulder and gently spun him
around. 
"Never " I said. "It's the Black Shadow - they won't accept it." 
"Wait a minute!" he shouted. "What do you mean, they won't accept it? Have
you made a deal with these pigs?"
"Certainly not," I said, pushing him along toward the gate. "But you
notice they're all armed. We're the only people here without guns. Can't
you hear that shooting over there?"
He paused, listened for an instant, then suddenly began,running toward the
car. "You cocksuckers!" he screamed over his shoulder. "We'll be back!"
By the time we got the shark back on the highway he was able to
talk. "Jesus christ! How did we get mixed up with that gang of psychotic
bigots? Let's get the fuck out of this town. Those scumbags were trying
to kill us!
 
5.Covering the Story . . . A Glimpse of the Press in Action . . . Ugliness
& Failure
 
The racers were ready at dawn. Fine sunrise over the desert. Very
tense. But the race didn't start until nine, so we had to kill about
three long hours in the casino next to the pits, and that's where the
trouble started.
The bar opened at seven. There was also a "koffee & donut canteen"
in the bunker, but those of us who had been up all night in places like
the Circus - Circus were in no mood for coffee & donuts. We wanted strong
drink. Our tempers were ugly and there were at least two hundred of us, so
they opened the bar early. By eight - thirty there were big crowds around
the crap - tables. The place was full of noise and drunken shouting.
A boney, middle - aged hoodlum wearing a Harley - Davidson T - shirt
boomed up to the bar and yelled: "God damn! What day is this - Saturday?"
"More like Sunday," somebody replied.
"Hah! That's a bitch, ain't it?" the H - D boomer shouted to nobody in
particular. "Last night I was out home in Long and somebody said they
were runnin' the Mint 400 so I says to my old lady, 'Man, I'm goin'." He
laughed.
"So she gives me a lot of crap about it, you know . . . so I started
slappin' her around and the next thing I knew two guys I never even seen
before got me out on the sidewalk workin' me over. Jesus! They beat me
stupid."
He laughed again, talking into the crowd and not seeming listened. 
"Hell yes!" he continued. "Then one of em says, 'Where you going?' And I
says, 'Las Vegas, to the Mint 400.' So they gave me ten bucks and drove
me down to the bus station . . . ." He paused. "At least I think it was
them . . . "
"Well, anyway, here I am. And I tell you that was one hell of a long
night, man! Seven hours on that goddamn bus! But when I woke up it was
dawn and here I was in downtown Vegas and for a minute I didn't know
what the hell I was doin' here. All I could think was, '0 Jesus, here
we go again: Who's divorced me this time?'"
He accepted a cigarette from somebody in the crowd, still grinning as
he lit up. "But then I remembered, by God! I was here for the Mint 400
. . . and, man, that's all I needed to know. I tell you it's wonderful to
be here, man. I don't give a damn who wins or loses. It's just wonderful
to be here with you people.
Nobody argued with him. We all understood. In some circles, the "Mint
400" is a far, far better thing than the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby
and the Lower Oakland Roller Derby Finals all rolled into one. This race
attracts a very special breed, and our man in the Harley T - shirt was
clearly one of them.
 
The correspondent from Life nodded sympathetically and screamed at the
bartender: "Senzaman wazzyneeds!"
"Fast up with it," I croaked. "Why not five?" I smacked the bar with my
open, bleeding palm. "Hell yes! Bring us ten!"
"I'll back it!" The Life man screamed. He was losing his grip on the bar,
sinking slowly to his knees, but still speaking with definite authority:
"This is a magic moment in sport! It may never come again!" Then his
voice seemed to break. "I once did the Triple Crown," he muttered. "But
it was nothing like this."
The frog - eyed woman clawed feverishly at his belt. "Stand up!" she
pleaded. "Please stand up! You'd be a very handsome man if you'd just
stand up!"
He laughed distractedly. "Listen, madam," he snapped. "I'm damn near
intolerably handsome down here where I am. You'd go crazy if I stood up!"
The woman kept pulling at him. She'd been mooning at his elbows for two
hours, and now she was making her move. The man from Life wanted no part
of it; he slumped deeper into his crouch.
I turned away. It was too horrible. We were, after all, the absolute
cream of the national sporting press. And we were gathered here in Las
Vegas for a very special assignment: to cover the Fourth Annual "Mint 400"
. . . and when it comes to things like this, you don't fool around.
But now - even before the spectacle got under way - there were signs that
we might be losing control of the situation. Here we were on this fine
Nevada morning, this cool bright dawn on the desert, hunkered down at
some greasy bar in a concrete blockhouse & gambling casino called the
"Mint Gun Club" about ten miles out of Vegas . . . and with the race
about to start, we were dangerously disorganized.
Outside, the lunatics were playing with their motorcycles, taping the
headlights, topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt - tightening
(carburetor screws, manifold nuts, etc.) and the first ten bikes blasted
off on the stroke of nine. It was extremely exciting and we all went outside to watch.
