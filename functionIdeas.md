#First ideas

Wolves (Lower Attack and Defense) Beginning enemy.

Bandits (Higher Attack Than Defense) Slight increase in difficulty.

Troll (Higher Level Wolf) Double wolves stats but still balanced "EX: Wolf is ATT:1-DEF:1 make troll ATT:4-DEF:4"

Golem (Higher Defense compared to attack) Make him like a tank.

Green Dragon (Higher attack than Defense)

Black squirrel with no tail (Be Difficult to a point.)
